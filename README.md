- 👋 Hi there, I’m Rohan King @neuroro, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Auckland
- 👀 I’m interested in neural circuitry and signalling, brain activity complexity, neural plasticity, memory (especially working memory), cogntive control and decision-making, neuroimaging analysis, mathematics, music, and experiencing existing (when I'm non-numeric)
- 🌱 I’m currently reading about new ways to measure connected neural activity
- 💞️ I’m keen to collaborate on brain activity analysis methods
- 📫 You can reach me at r.king@auckland.ac.nz
